# üõ°Ô∏è SOC EZ Tool ‚Äì Portfolio Project

This project is part of my personal cybersecurity portfolio, built to demonstrate hands-on SOC analyst skills. **SOC EZ Tool** simulates a real-world log analysis workflow, extracting IPs from log files, checking their reputation with the VirusTotal API, and generating structured threat reports.

It was built to show not only my ability to write functional Python scripts, but also to think like an analyst: gathering intelligence, validating threat indicators, and documenting findings cleanly.
